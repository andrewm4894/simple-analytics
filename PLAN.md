## âœ… Phase 2: Core Data Models (COMPLETED)
- [x] Project model with API keys, settings, and **flexible sampling configuration**
- [x] EventSource model for source management with optional project overrides
- [x] Event model with flexible JSONB schema and smart defaults
- [x] Database migrations with comprehensive indexing strategy
- [x] Session ID generation logic (user + 60min window)
- [x] User ID fallback generation (IP + UserAgent hash)
- [x] **BONUS:** Multi-level sampling strategy (project/source/event level)

## âœ… Phase 3: Ingestion API (COMPLETED)
- [x] Event ingestion REST endpoint (`POST /api/events/ingest`)
- [x] API key authentication middleware with Bearer token support
- [x] Redis-based rate limiting (per project and IP with sliding window)
- [x] **Flexible sampling implementation** integrated with ingestion flow
- [x] Input validation and sanitization with 64KB properties limit
- [x] Redis stream integration for reliable event queuing
- [x] Django management command for testing ingestion pipeline
- [x] Comprehensive error handling and logging
- [x] **BONUS:** Professional code formatting with automated linting

## âœ… Phase 4: Background Processing (COMPLETED)
- [x] Choose worker system (Django-RQ vs Celery) â†’ **Django-RQ selected**
- [x] Redis â†’ PostgreSQL event processor with consumer groups
- [x] Error handling and retry logic for failed events
- [x] Monitoring and logging for processors with detailed status commands
- [x] Basic aggregation jobs (daily/hourly stats) with project summaries
- [x] Data cleanup jobs (retention policies) 
- [x] Worker management commands and monitoring tools
- [x] **BONUS:** Comprehensive aggregation models with source breakdown and top events

## âœ… Phase 5: Dashboard API (COMPLETED)
- [x] Event querying API with filtering and pagination
- [x] **Dual API key security model** (public for ingestion, private for dashboard)
- [x] Project-based data isolation and authentication
- [x] Aggregation endpoints for daily/hourly/5-minute stats
- [x] Real-time metrics endpoints for dashboard widgets
- [x] Performance optimization for queries with proper indexing
- [x] Custom authentication classes and permission system
- [x] **BONUS:** Comprehensive serializers and organized URL patterns

## ðŸš§ Phase 6: Testing & Tooling (NEXT)
- [ ] Unit tests for models and APIs
- [ ] **Dual API key authentication testing** (public vs private)
- [ ] **Sampling strategy testing** (random, deterministic, time-window)
- [ ] Integration tests for ingestion pipeline
- [ ] Dashboard API endpoint testing with filtering/pagination
- [ ] Load testing scripts and scenarios (with sampling scenarios)
- [ ] Demo event generation scripts
- [ ] Performance monitoring setup
- [ ] API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)

## Phase 7: Future Dashboard (Later)
- [ ] React application setup
- [ ] Dashboard UI components
- [ ] Real-time updates integration
- [ ] Visualization components
- [ ] Export functionality
- [ ] Admin panel for project management
