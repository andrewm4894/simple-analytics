# Simple Analytics Stack - Implementation Plan

## âœ… Phase 1: Project Foundation (COMPLETED)
- [x] Set up uv project structure and dependencies
- [x] Create Makefile for common commands
- [x] Docker Compose setup (Django, PostgreSQL, Redis)
- [x] Django project initialization with DRF
- [x] Basic project configuration and settings
- [x] **BONUS:** Professional linting and code quality tools (Ruff, Black, MyPy, Bandit, Pre-commit)

## âœ… Phase 2: Core Data Models (COMPLETED)
- [x] Project model with API keys, settings, and **flexible sampling configuration**
- [x] EventSource model for source management with optional project overrides
- [x] Event model with flexible JSONB schema and smart defaults
- [x] Database migrations with comprehensive indexing strategy
- [x] Session ID generation logic (user + 60min window)
- [x] User ID fallback generation (IP + UserAgent hash)
- [x] **BONUS:** Multi-level sampling strategy (project/source/event level)

## âœ… Phase 3: Ingestion API (COMPLETED)
- [x] Event ingestion REST endpoint (`POST /api/events/ingest`)
- [x] API key authentication middleware with Bearer token support
- [x] Redis-based rate limiting (per project and IP with sliding window)
- [x] **Flexible sampling implementation** integrated with ingestion flow
- [x] Input validation and sanitization with 64KB properties limit
- [x] Redis stream integration for reliable event queuing
- [x] Django management command for testing ingestion pipeline
- [x] Comprehensive error handling and logging
- [x] **BONUS:** Professional code formatting with automated linting

## ðŸš§ Phase 4: Background Processing (NEXT)
- [ ] Choose worker system (Django-RQ vs Celery)
- [ ] Redis â†’ PostgreSQL event processor
- [ ] Error handling and retry logic
- [ ] Monitoring and logging for processors
- [ ] Basic aggregation jobs
- [ ] Data cleanup jobs (retention policies)

## Phase 5: Dashboard API
- [ ] Event querying API with filtering
- [ ] Project-based data isolation
- [ ] User authentication for dashboard
- [ ] Basic aggregation endpoints
- [ ] Performance optimization for queries
- [ ] Admin endpoints for project management

## Phase 6: Testing & Tooling
- [ ] Unit tests for models and APIs
- [ ] **Sampling strategy testing** (random, deterministic, time-window)
- [ ] Integration tests for ingestion pipeline
- [ ] Load testing scripts and scenarios (with sampling scenarios)
- [ ] Demo event generation scripts
- [ ] Performance monitoring setup
- [ ] API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)

## Phase 7: Future Dashboard (Later)
- [ ] React application setup
- [ ] Dashboard UI components
- [ ] Real-time updates integration
- [ ] Visualization components
- [ ] Export functionality
- [ ] Admin panel for project management

## Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed Features
- **Multi-project architecture** with UUID-based isolation
- **Flexible sampling system** (random, deterministic, time-window strategies)
- **Smart user identification** (client-provided, cookie-based, IP+UserAgent fallback)
- **Configurable project settings** (rate limits, retention, CORS, sampling)
- **Professional development environment** with automated code quality checks
- **Hybrid Docker approach** (databases containerized, Django native for development)
- **High-performance event ingestion API** with authentication and rate limiting
- **Redis-based event queuing** with reliable stream processing
- **Comprehensive testing tools** including Django management commands

### ðŸŽ¯ Current Focus: Phase 4 - Background Processing
Building the event processing pipeline that will:
1. Consume events from Redis streams reliably
2. Transform and store events in PostgreSQL
3. Handle processing errors with retry logic
4. Create basic aggregations for dashboard consumption
5. Implement data retention and cleanup policies

### ðŸ”„ Architecture Highlights
- **Near real-time processing** (1-5 minute acceptable delay)
- **Sampling-first approach** to control costs and volume
- **Event source flexibility** with per-source overrides
- **Security-focused** with rate limiting and input validation
- **Reliable event ingestion** with Redis stream queuing

## Success Criteria Progress

### âœ… Foundation (Achieved)
- Professional development environment with linting
- Containerized databases with persistent volumes
- Flexible data models ready for scale

### âœ… Phase 3 Goals (Achieved)
- High-performance event ingestion endpoint
- Robust authentication and rate limiting
- Sampling integration reducing storage costs
- Redis queuing for reliable processing

### ðŸŽ¯ Phase 4 Goals
- Background worker system for event processing
- Reliable Redis â†’ PostgreSQL data pipeline
- Error handling and monitoring for workers
- Basic aggregation jobs for dashboard data

### ðŸ“ˆ Future Milestones
- Dashboard API with aggregations
- Comprehensive testing and monitoring
- Load testing validation
- React frontend development
