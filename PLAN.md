# Simple Analytics Stack - Implementation Plan

## âœ… Phase 1: Project Foundation (COMPLETED)
- [x] Set up uv project structure and dependencies
- [x] Create Makefile for common commands
- [x] Docker Compose setup (Django, PostgreSQL, Redis)
- [x] Django project initialization with DRF
- [x] Basic project configuration and settings
- [x] **BONUS:** Professional linting and code quality tools (Ruff, Black, MyPy, Bandit, Pre-commit)

## âœ… Phase 2: Core Data Models (COMPLETED)
- [x] Project model with API keys, settings, and **flexible sampling configuration**
- [x] EventSource model for source management with optional project overrides
- [x] Event model with flexible JSONB schema and smart defaults
- [x] Database migrations with comprehensive indexing strategy
- [x] Session ID generation logic (user + 60min window)
- [x] User ID fallback generation (IP + UserAgent hash)
- [x] **BONUS:** Multi-level sampling strategy (project/source/event level)

## âœ… Phase 3: Ingestion API (COMPLETED)
- [x] Event ingestion REST endpoint (`POST /api/events/ingest`)
- [x] API key authentication middleware with Bearer token support
- [x] Redis-based rate limiting (per project and IP with sliding window)
- [x] **Flexible sampling implementation** integrated with ingestion flow
- [x] Input validation and sanitization with 64KB properties limit
- [x] Redis stream integration for reliable event queuing
- [x] Django management command for testing ingestion pipeline
- [x] Comprehensive error handling and logging
- [x] **BONUS:** Professional code formatting with automated linting

## âœ… Phase 4: Background Processing (COMPLETED)
- [x] Choose worker system (Django-RQ vs Celery) â†’ **Django-RQ selected**
- [x] Redis â†’ PostgreSQL event processor with consumer groups
- [x] Error handling and retry logic for failed events
- [x] Monitoring and logging for processors with detailed status commands
- [x] Basic aggregation jobs (daily/hourly stats) with project summaries
- [x] Data cleanup jobs (retention policies) 
- [x] Worker management commands and monitoring tools
- [x] **BONUS:** Comprehensive aggregation models with source breakdown and top events

## ðŸš§ Phase 5: Dashboard API (NEXT)
- [ ] Event querying API with filtering and pagination
- [ ] Project-based data isolation and authentication
- [ ] Aggregation endpoints for daily/hourly stats
- [ ] Real-time metrics endpoints
- [ ] Performance optimization for queries with proper indexing
- [ ] Admin endpoints for project management

## Phase 6: Testing & Tooling
- [ ] Unit tests for models and APIs
- [ ] **Sampling strategy testing** (random, deterministic, time-window)
- [ ] Integration tests for ingestion pipeline
- [ ] Load testing scripts and scenarios (with sampling scenarios)
- [ ] Demo event generation scripts
- [ ] Performance monitoring setup
- [ ] API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)

## Phase 7: Future Dashboard (Later)
- [ ] React application setup
- [ ] Dashboard UI components
- [ ] Real-time updates integration
- [ ] Visualization components
- [ ] Export functionality
- [ ] Admin panel for project management

## Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed Features
- **Multi-project architecture** with UUID-based isolation
- **Flexible sampling system** (random, deterministic, time-window strategies)
- **Smart user identification** (client-provided, cookie-based, IP+UserAgent fallback)
- **Configurable project settings** (rate limits, retention, CORS, sampling)
- **Professional development environment** with automated code quality checks
- **Hybrid Docker approach** (databases containerized, Django native for development)
- **High-performance event ingestion API** with authentication and rate limiting
- **Redis-based event queuing** with reliable stream processing
- **Comprehensive testing tools** including Django management commands
- **Background processing pipeline** with Django-RQ and Redis consumer groups
- **Event aggregation system** with daily/hourly summaries and project analytics
- **Production-ready monitoring** with detailed status commands and error handling

### ðŸŽ¯ Current Focus: Phase 5 - Dashboard API
Building the analytics API that will:
1. Provide event querying with filtering and pagination
2. Serve aggregated metrics from daily/hourly summaries
3. Handle project-based data isolation and authentication
4. Offer real-time metrics endpoints for dashboards
5. Optimize query performance with proper indexing

### ðŸ”„ Architecture Highlights
- **Near real-time processing** (1-5 minute acceptable delay)
- **Sampling-first approach** to control costs and volume
- **Event source flexibility** with per-source overrides
- **Security-focused** with rate limiting and input validation
- **Reliable event ingestion** with Redis stream queuing
